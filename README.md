<h1>React Portfolio Application<h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Created With: React, state, hooks, props, JSX, conditional rendering, form validation, tailwind + css, MVC structure. </br>
 First: I've created a react app</br> 
 Second: I've installed dependancies + for tailwindcss dependancies </br> 
 Third: Once I've connected to server, I have created About Me "home render"</br>
 Fourth: Then Ive made Header and Footer components that show correct page once clicked. </br>
 Fifth: I've made sure that the 'category click' updates the webpage title. </br>
 Sixth: Then I've made the Portfolio component and displayed 6 of my projects in cards that show links and are responsive.</br>
 Seventh: I've then made the Contact component and have made sure that the form has validation and have put a few icons to contact me via email/phone. </br>
 Eighth: Then I've made the Resume component and have listed my proficiencies as-well as a downloadle link to Resume('needs 2 be updated') </br>
 Ninth: I've then used some CSS animations to make the page more active and brushed up some break point issues </br>
 Once all functionality was completed I've used React to deploy live on GitHub Pages <a href ="https://hacatac.github.io/hac-portfolio/" target="_blank">Link to deployed application.</a>. </br>

## User Story

AS AN employer </br>
I'm looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications </br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples </br>
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position </br>

GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer </br>
WHEN I load the portfolio </br>
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer
WHEN I view the header </br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio </br>
WHEN I view the navigation titles </br>
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted</br>
WHEN I click on a navigation title</br>
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted</br>
WHEN I load the portfolio the first time</br>
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default</br>
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section</br>
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them</br>
WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section</br>
THEN I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repository</br>
WHEN I am presented with the Contact section</br>
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message
WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text</br>
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required</br>
WHEN I enter text into the email address field</br>
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address</br>
WHEN I am presented with the Resume section</br>
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies</br>
WHEN I view the footer</br>
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter) </br>
