<h1>React Portfolio Application<h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Created With: React, state, hooks, props, JSX, conditional rendering, form validation, tailwind + css, MVC structure. </br>
 First: I've created a react app</br> 
 Second: I've installed dependancies + for tailwindcss dependancies </br> 
 Third: Once I've connected to server, I have created About Me "home render"</br>
 Fourth: Then Ive made Header and Footer components that show correct page once clicked. </br>
 Fifth: I've made sure that the 'category click' updates the webpage title. </br>
 Sixth: Then I've made the Portfolio component and displayed 6 of my projects in cards that show links and are responsive.</br>
 Seventh: I've then made the Contact component and have made sure that the form has validation and have put a few icons to contact me via email/phone. </br>
 Eighth: Then I've made the Resume component and have listed my proficiencies as-well as a downloadle link to Resume('needs 2 be updated') </br>
 Ninth: I've then used some CSS animations to make the page more active and brushed up some break point issues </br>
 Once all functionality was completed I've used React to deploy live on GitHub Pages <a href ="https://hacatac.github.io/hac-portfolio/" target="_blank">Link to deployed application.</a>. </br>
